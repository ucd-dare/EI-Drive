Welcome to EI-Drive's documentation!
===================================
EI-Drive is an open-source platform provides solution for joint simulation of edge communication and cooperative perception, aimed at safe and efficient cooperative driving automation.

Integrating cooperative perception with realistic communication models, EI-Drive allows to explore the impact of communication latency and errors on not only cooperative perception but also the overall performance of autonomous driving.
